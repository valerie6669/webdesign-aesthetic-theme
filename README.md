## Dawn colour palette Extension

This is a pleasant and simple colour pallet for your browser, an aesthetic theme. The fonts and colour scheme are altered in a way that is appealing on your eyes when you boot up your computer at the crack of dawn to start the day. There was a valiant attempt at changing the cursor appearance and I will persevere because who doesnâ€™t want a sun or moon as their cursor? Planning on adding a second background change based more so into a nighttime theme, but for now this will do okay.
